# It is from Supplementary Table 18, which presents data on
# a Cas9 screen for off-target effects by targeting across the
# human CD33 coding sequence:
# ```
#  We sought to under- stand off-target effects under typical
#  pooled-screening conditions in mammalian cells using a library
#  targeting the coding sequence of human CD33 with all possible sgRNAs,
#  regardless of PAM. For all sites with the canonical NGG PAM, in
#  addition to the perfect-match sgRNAs, we introduced three types of
#  sgRNA mutations: first, all 1-nucleotide deletions; second, all
#  1-nucleotide insertions; third, all 1-nucleotide mismatches to the
#  target DNA, generating a library with 27,897 unique sgRNAs. To these
#  we added 10,618 sgRNAs targeting the mouse Thy1 locus to serve as
#  negative controls.
# ```
#
# Human CD33 targets are annotated with `ENST00000262262` and mouse
# (negative control) targets are annotated with `ENSMUST00000114840`
#
# The paper looked at the activity profile of perfect match sgRNAs with
# the canonical NGG PAM, to find a region in CD33 where targeting leads
# to loss of function. This is shown in Supplementary Figure 19: it
# is where the percentage of the protein (i.e., how far along the
# coding sequence) is about 5% through 59%. To be safe, we'll only
# look where the target site is between 7% and 57%. This percentage is
# given in a column of the data.
#
# Also, we'll only want to look at perfect matches, varied PAMs, and
# mismatches (so leave out insertions and deletions).
#
# In case we rely on order later (e.g., to split train/test), this
# should also randomly shuffle the rows.
